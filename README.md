## Pinout

| Pin | Signal|
| --- | ----- |
| 1 | SD\_SS |
| 2 | SD\_MOSI |
| 3 | SD\_MISO |
| 4 | SD\_SCK |
| 5 | GND |
| 6 | 3V3 |
| 7 | SD\_DAT1 |
| 8 | SD\_DAT2 |
| 9 | SD\_CD |
| 10 | SD\_VSEL18 |
| 11 | GND |
| 12 | 3V3 |

Note: 1.8V signals are used when SD\_VSEL18 is high, or 3.3V when low (default).

Note: When SD\_CD is asserted high for >100mS, power is shut off to the MicroSD card, allowing reset. All other signals should be held low during reset.
